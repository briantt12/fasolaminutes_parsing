The devotional was conducted by Alvaro Duarte.Tuesday, July 3==Lesson: Rudiments I / Youth I / Basics==9:00 a.m. Teachers Lauren Bock and Jesse P. Karlsberg began the singing school by asking the students the questions “what is sound?,” “what is music?,” “what is pitch?,” and “what is rhythm?” The class determined that music is a succession of pleasing tones, and decided that pitch relates to how high or low a musical sound is, whereas rhythm relates to the lengths of notes in time. The teachers then asked the students “What is Sacred Harp music?” The class discussed this as well as the ways in which Sacred Harp is different from other kinds of music.The singing school turned to the topic of melodics. Lauren and the class looked at the different shape notes, their names, and their purpose. Lauren led the class in singing the major scale and the intervals within the scale. Jesse then led the class in an exercise where students holding shape notes stood in a row according to height and had to pass the notes back and forth to put the scale in order.After a break the singing school turned to rhythmics. Jesse asked the students to define tempo, and after some discussion, taught the class the different durations of notes and rests. Lauren led the class in an exercise using notes and rests made out of felt and the students picked different sets of notes and rests that added up to an equal duration.==Lesson: Rudiments I / Youth II / Basics==9:00 a.m. This class included Sacred Harp basics of scales, intervals, modes of time, and accent with teaching methods appropriate for older youth. Stuart Ivey opened the lesson with some breathing exercises for the singers. In singing any good note, Stuart said there are four characteristics to consider; pitch (how high or how low); duration/rhythm (how long the note is held); style/accent; volume/dynamics. Stuart had the class sing the tenor line of [31t], emphasizing how each of the four items ought to be kept in mind to sing our best.Drew Smith had the class review the major and minor scales. He talked about the tonic note (fa or la) and how successive notes advance in degree from the tonic sound. He had the class review [37b] to exercise his point, taking note of where voice parts begin and end. This helps a singer establish the key and understand the movement of the chords. Drew reviewed the layout of each song with the clef furthest to the left, then the time signature and then the sharps and flats that determine the key of the song. This is good to know, though not essential for singers who are not keying a song. The time signature of a song is vital for a leader to be aware of as they lead a lesson. Drew also explained the names at the top of a song. The name and date on the top left refers to the author of the lyrics and the year of their creation. The name on the top right attributes a song’s melody and harmony to a composer. The Bible verse underneath the title helps a singer contextualize the song and its meaning.Stuart had the class practice singing their intervals on the staff. A good singer can approach an unfamiliar song and sing it well by practicing their intervals and other characteristics of a note. Stuart reviewed the duration of time each note receives when we sing, making parallel to amounts of money. He pointed to the second brace of [358] explaining that joined eighth notes indicate carried syllables, whereas, flagged notes indicate separate syllables of a text.==Lesson: Rudiments I / Young Adults==9:00 a.m. The class began by singing [39b]. Sam Sommers stated to the class that “the only requirement to sing Sacred Harp is a desire to sing Sacred Harp”. Traditions are maintained because they keep the music alive! Tradition means we pass on that which we have received. We do not invent tradition; it is given to us.The class reviewed the scales and covered Rhythmics on pg. 15 of the Rudiments. By definition, the leader is always right, so you have to look up to see the leader! The seven modes of time were explained-- three common modes, two triple modes and two common modes. The class reviewed [70t] to demonstrate 2/2 time, observing the rests. For an explanation of repeats and accent, the class sang [108b] (4/4 time) and had further discussion of accent and tempo on [170] (2/4 time).Sam referred to the Rudiments for explanation and discussion held during the class. In regard to leading, Sam said to always start and end with your hand up. Discussion of etiquette in Sacred Harp included leading with or without a book. Sam said that using the book is recommended. Past generations greatly emphasized leading without a book; however, he teaches to lead with your book. Do not be too creative with tempos. Finally, use modest arm strokes while leading, and keep your movement within the frame of your body. The class ended by singing [137], with the alto as written.==Elective: Sacred Harp Composition {101}==10:45 a.m. This class included singers who have recently begun to compose music and those interested in doing so. Aldo Ceresa shared tips for getting started writing parts and basic elements of harmony. Aldo opened the class by singing [39t]. Aldo asked, “What makes this music sound the way it does and makes people want to sing it for over one hundred years?” The focus of this class was how to write music in the tradition of Sacred Harp music, and how to write music the Sacred Harp singers will love and enjoy. Aldo told the class to use the Sacred Harp Rudiments as their guide in writing Sacred Harp music. Look for patterns and learn to recognize different styles in the book, for example, camp meeting songs, fuging tunes, folk songs, or hymns. Look for common note patterns. Another way is to learn from living composers.Aldo told the class to sing your music as you write it. Do not rely on computers or instruments too much. Singers will be the real test in the quality of your song. Aldo suggested writers begin with the text, and make sure you have the correct mode of time. Writing involves a lot of trial and error. Remember that music is a sort of conversation between singers and composers. Incorporate feedback about what you write and do not get too attached to your notes! Write the parts in the order of tenor, bass, treble, and then alto. Fit your tune in a key to minimize ledger lines. Sing the different parts to get a feel for them and keep the part within comfortable ranges. Tenor is the melody. The bass anchors the harmony and is often the root note. The bass should always end on the key note. Treble adds brilliance and harmonic definition to the music, and the alto is the filling that makes the tune complete. Aldo presented the class with charts of common chords in major and minor. For the remainder of Camp, this class participated in a round-robin writing exercise called “Team Tunesmith”. The writing exercises will be sung at the Composium session at the end of Camp.==Elective: Sacred Harp and the Silver Screen==10:45 a.m. This class explored Sacred Harp’s influence in film with Lela Crowder. Lela posed a question to the class, “When has music set a tone?” Responses from the class were from horror films to Disney, church services, weddings, funerals to military music. Lela’s second question was” What kind of reaction did you have to Sacred Harp music when you first heard it?” Most agree the music is haunting and powerful, and everybody is involved to the highest degree. Both elements of joy and sorrow are felt. Lela asked, “Can you think of an instance where you did not expect to hear Sacred Harp music?” Some examples given were alternative music, public places, and artists who make their own arrangements. The class sang [312b] and reactions about the song were that it was an upbeat, joyful, minor tune with a majestic mood. Lela presented some clips beginning with the film Geronimo. The class heard excerpts of [312b] in different scenes. The scenes depicted majestic vistas with instrumentals and full orchestral arrangements heard in the background. Another scene in Geronimo plays [457] and builds in intensity during the sentencing of traitors. The final clip shows a military band with “Oh Come Away” and a stringed arrangement of [457].Hugh McGraw was shown in a clip from The Long Ride Home singing a song from The Social Harp during a funeral scene. Adaptations of “Happy Land” were played through the opening credits and during the closing scene in Arsenic and Old Lace. A clip from a remake of The Ladykillers features [408] while an assassin tries to kill an elderly lady. Two of the most familiar songs ([47b] and [282]) among Sacred Harp singers were shown in clips from Cold Mountain.==Lesson: Best of the Ungreatest Hits==1:00 p.m. David Ivey greeted the class and led [169]. According to the minutes, from 1995 to 2010, [169] was the “least” used song. David speculated as to why some songs are sung so little. David gave the statistic that from 1995 to 2011, the song led most often was 146, and the second most led was 155. David made note of the fact that he had noticed through the years that popularity of songs have an ebb and flow to them. The class was given a list of the least used Sacred Harp songs and encouraged to lead some of them from time to time. The list can also be found on the Fasola website. The remaining time was used singing some of the “ungreatest hits”. Leaders: Bethany Towne [429]; Jeannette DePoy [516]; Carol Munro Mosley [152]; Marcus Whitman [416]; Hannah Land [289]; Deidra Montgomery [185]; Holly Hamrick [88b]; Aldo Ceresa [407]; Sam Sommers [412]; Oliver Stokes and Ethan Hardy [462]; Blake Sisemore [404]; Rob Kelley [184]; Alvaro Duarte [359]; Christopher Mann [92]; Amy Armstrong and J.R. Hardman [487]; Cassie Allen [130]; Nathan Rees [517]; Judy Caudle [202]; Tom Stokes [360]; Katy Kanfer [132]; Alvaro Duarte [126].==Elective: More Rudiments and Practice==2:30 p.m. This elective session was held for those who wanted more Rudiments and practice. Robert Kelley discussed the three departments of music at length in this class: rhythmics, melodics, dynamics, and another important component, poetry. Robert emphasized that the music is primarily a vehicle for expressing the poetry. He gave these things to consider with respect to the words; timing, rhythm, accent, and pronunciation. Robert discussed the relationships between accent and timing, melody and accent, tune and text, and then gave examples of when the accent, tune, or text may conflict. Robert reviewed accent, rhythm, modes of time, and how to select an appropriate tempo for a song based on the mode of time. Class discussion included the Rudiments and how we sing today differs from earlier recommendations. Robert led [39b] and [183].==Lesson: How To Beat the Seven Modes of Time / Youth==4:00 p.m. The mechanics of beating time for the seven modes of time used in Sacred Harp was the focus in this class, including demonstration and practice.Jesse P. Karlsberg explained the three different types of time signatures: common, triple, and compound. The time signature is a symbol of two numbers. The top number is the number of beats in a measure. The bottom number tells what kind of note gets the beat. The class gave different examples of how to fill a measure. Jesse referred to pgs. 15-16 in the Rudiments, and the class practiced singing and keeping time to the exercises. The differences in 4/4 and 2/2 time were discussed in terms of relative tempo. The class sang [49t] as an example of 2/2 time, [37b] as an example of 4/4 time, and [87] as an example of 2/4 time.Stuart Ivey talked about leading a song, and encouraged class members to stand with good posture and use your hinges to lead. He said do not use the shoulder or wrist as much as the elbow. The class sang [49b] as an example of 3/2 time, and then [45t] as an example of 3/4 time. The class practiced compound time by singing [146] as an example of 6/4 time, and [196] as an example of 6/8 time. Stuart continued with tips about leading and then dismissed the class.==Lesson: Leading Bringing in Parts / Adults==4:00 p.m. Through workshop songs led by members of the class, this lesson taught the basics of how to lead a song at a Sacred Harp singing, focusing on what decisions the leader should make before stepping into the hollow square and how to communicate your desires to the class. An introduction was given by Judy Caudle, who reminded the leaders to accent with the voice, not the hand. Leaders: Judy Caudle [155]; J.R. Hardman [504]; Deidra Montgomery [316]; Carol Munro Mosley [196]; Blake Sisemore [556]; Holly Hamrick [300]; Bethany Towne [397]; Willis McCumber [472]; Ellen Lueck [193]; Susan Cherones [209]; Lori Rodgers [183]; Ethan Hardy [91]; Eimear O’Donovan [182]; Jackson Harcrow [532].==Lesson: Songs in Major and Minor==4:00 p.m. This class practiced singing major and minor tunes with Scott DePoy and Jeannette DePoy. They discussed why major and minor songs sound different.==Elective: Dinner on the Ground==5:00 p.m. This class explored the significance and evolution of “dinner on the ground” in the Sacred Harp tradition with Karen Ivey. Dinner stories were shared. How to organize and prepare a meal and how to transport your food to a singing was discussed. The class made recipe books of favorite dishes from past and present cooks.==Elective: Arranging Committee==5:00 p.m. Determining and announcing the order of song leaders at a singing is more than just calling names. It is one of the key ingredients in an excellent singing. The class covered what to consider when arranging at a singing and participated in fun hands-on arranging exercises with Jesse Karlsberg.==Elective: Keying Music==5:00 p.m. Practical considerations were offered by David Ivey for keying Sacred Harp songs. The most important thing about keying is listening. Few people can just do it. Most people that key do it by listening, observing, and persevering. Having a person to encourage you helps, but keying is mostly self-learned. According to pg. 17, Chapter 3 in the Rudiments, Sacred Harp music should be pitched so all singers can comfortably reach their parts. The last note in the bass will be the tonic. Tonics of major songs are “fa” and minor songs are “la”. The tonic note is the home note and the most important one. Most people learn to key out of necessity simply because there is no else to do it. The hardest part is having the courage to key. Start practicing at small singings. One learns from making mistakes. It helps to listen to recordings. If you want to key, you must master the scale. Seventy percent of songs in Sacred Harp are in major. If you have some typical songs memorized, you can apply that remembered note to a new song in the same key. Consider the time of day when pitching. For example, key the same song lower at 9:30 a.m. than what you might key it at 11:30 a.m. You can usually pitch a little higher after lunch, if it is a strong singing. Practice, practice, practice!==Class Singing==7:30 p.m. led by Youth Girls. Co-chairmen Benedicta Hardy and Elizabeth Schultz led [86]. The opening prayer was offered by Jennifer Betz.Leaders: Holly Mixon and Katy Wacaster [388]; Jeannette DePoy [89]; Connor Campbell and Alvaro Duarte [74b]; Shelby Castillo and Jason Steidl [40]; Hannah Land and Jesse Karlsberg [432]; Christopher Mann and Bethany Towne {138}; Benjamin Mann, Nicholas Mann, and William Clay [335]; Erica Hinton, Matt Hinton, and Eli Hinton [105]; Nathan Reese and Jonathon Smith [449]; William Schnorenberg and Blake Sisemore [186]; Ollie Stokes and Eimear O’Donovan [445]; Jonathon Pendleton and Eli Hinton [354b]; Ellen Lueck and Eva Striebeck [369]; Jubal Schultz, Jarius Schultz, Jedidiah Schultz, and Tommy Schultz [70b]; Marcus Whitman and Drew Smith [183]; Jeff Sheppard, Shelbie Sheppard, Rene Greene, and Pam Nunn [216]; Lauren Bock, Anna Hinton, and Jeannette DePoy [276]; Benedicta Hardy and Ethan Hardy [33b]; David Ivey and Susan Harcrow [456]; Justin Corbett and Ethan Corbett [155]; Holly Hauck and Jackson Fleder [61]; Amy Armstrong and Donna Sewell [460]; Lori Rodgers and Jo Pendleton [503]; Tom Stokes and Konrad Tegtmeier [119]; Aldo Ceresa and Samuel Sommers [550]; Katy Kanfer and Anita Landess [44]; Deidra Montgomery, Rachel Rudi, and Lela Crowder [153]. Benedicta Hardy and Elizabeth Schultz led [45b] as the closing song. The closing prayer was offered by Jennifer Betz. The devotional was conducted by Lainey Martin.Wednesday, July 4==Lesson: Rudiments II / Youth I / Basics==9:00 a.m. The second day of singing school began with rhythmics. Teachers Lauren Bock and Jesse P. Karlsberg asked the students “what is a measure?” and “what is a measure bar?” Having settled on answers, the class next turned to the modes of time. Jesse and Lauren introduced each of the seven modes of time. The students demonstrated, using notes and rests of their choosing, some of the different combinations that can fill a measure for each of the modes.After a stretch break, the class reviewed melodics. Lauren asked the class “what is an octave?” Lauren suggested that if a scale is like steps on a staircase, then the octave is like successive stories in a house. Using a diagram that demonstrated this analogy, Lauren pointed at the front step of the house while Jesse sang the lowest note he could manage. Lauren then led Jesse upward, and he sang all the way up to the top of the house (much to the amusement of the class). The instructors then reviewed the major scale and demonstrated how melodies can be made out of notes in the scale by leading the class in the songs “Joy to the World” and “Twinkle, Twinkle” while pointing at the appropriate notes on the scale.The class then turned to a page in (i The Sacred Harp). The students looked at how melodics and rhythmics were each indicated in the musical notation on the page. Lauren and Jesse taught the class the “anatomy of a song,” pointing out the different parts, and characters such as repeat markers, slurs, bars, and ties. The class then sang the melody to [37b] before concluding for the day.==Lesson: Rudiments II / Youth II / Basics==9:00 a.m. Stuart Ivey and Deidra Montgomery taught the basics of scales, intervals, modes of time, and accent appropriate for older youths. Stuart told the class that there were four things to know: volume, pitch, rhythm, and accent. He gave the class an exercise in scales where each separate note of the scale, enlarged on paper, was randomly placed under eight seats in the class and the eight class members that found a note under their seat had to line up in order of height, and then exchange notes until they were in the correct order of the scale. The class members were given thirty-five seconds to get in the proper order. After lining up in the correct order of the scale, the class sang the notes. This exercise was done a second time and was completed in twenty-two seconds.Deidra presented to the class the anatomy of Sacred Harp according to the Rudiments found in the front of the book. The class turned to pg. 15 of the Rudiments, and sang the exercises for each of the modes of time and beat time while singing. The class reviewed joined flags, slurs, and ties, and learned the difference between mandatory repeats and optional repeats. On pg. 14 of the Rudiments, the class reviewed the D.C. or “da capo”, and then how a bird’s eye works on pg. 17. On pg. 17, section 18 of the Rudiments, she explained triplets, and the class sang [31t]. Deidra explained singing with accent and that it helps to emphasize the text correctly and helps keep the class together while singing. The best sounding songs are the ones sung with accent. There are primary and secondary accents. In 4/4 time, the primary accent is on the first note and the secondary accent is on the third note. The class turned to pg. 15 of the Rudiments, and sang the examples of each mode of time with proper accent. Tempo is the speed of beats in each mode of time, and the class discussed faster tempo versus slower tempo. Deidra stated that when you are leading, keep the tempo you want and do not change it or let the class change it.To complete the lesson, Stuart and the class practiced singing the minor scale.==Lesson: Rudiments II / Young Adults==9:00 a.m. Sam Sommers welcomed the class and offered prayer. Sam said that everyone here is a Sacred Harp singer and the only requirement is the desire to be a Sacred Harp singer. Music is made up of rhythmics, melodics, and dynamics. We only sing in two keys, “fa” and “la”. The class practiced the major scale and singing intervals. The spaces between the notes are tremendously important. Minor is another mood; it does not mean sad. For example, “God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen” is in minor but is not a sad song. Sam provided the class with a handout of the Rudiments from the B. F. White Book and practiced intervals. Practice creates a firm foundation in learning Sacred Harp music.The class reviewed the different modes of time on pg. 15 and 16 of the Rudiments. Sam instructed that when leading, begin with the hand up and move it down towards the center of the earth. The leader should keep their beat pattern within “the frame of modesty”. The class reviewed [31t], noting the triplets. Sam suggested choosing something specific to focus on while at a singing, such as watching the leader or practicing accent. Rests are a period of silence, so silent “you could hear a bird chirp”! Transgressions against a rest include holding a note too long, foot tapping, or talking (“I fry my pies in butter”). The last note of every bass line is the tonic. The class reviewed [98] for compound time, accent, and repeats. The beginning repeat is mandatory and the ending repeat is optional. The class closed by singing [62].==Elective: Innovative Sounds in Sacred Harp 1960-1991==10:30 a.m. The class included a mixture of stories and discussion of songs composed for the 1960-1991 revisions of the Sacred Harp that take dispersed harmony in new directions, and why we enjoy certain sounds in the book. Robert Kelley brought the class to order by leading [512]. The class looked at [462] and Robert noted the moments where the bass rises above the tenor and where the treble goes from a high tonic “fa” to a “mi”. Since 1960, this had become more common. Robert discussed the music of Hugh McGraw, Raymond Hamrick, and Marcus Cagle. Hugh McGraw’s music is influenced by gospel (see [548]). He generally opposes discords. Raymond Hamrick uses discords strategically. He is influenced by classical music. Much of his music has a “tall sound”, which is also found in McGraw and Cagle tunes. Marcus Cagle also studied classical music. He liked to add a bit of “science” to his music: accidentals, weird chords. His music fits extraordinarily well with Sacred Harp accent. The phenomenon of tall songs led to [549], where the bass and tenor or treble are more than an octave apart. He also noted the predominance of sweet chords in the song. There are precedents for tall songs in the music of J.P. and H.S. Reese (e.g. [39b] and [400]). Robert led [521], another tall song featuring sweet chords. Robert referred to the song on page [378b]. The song has several moments where the tenor crosses the bass and several discords. Robert had the class look at [385t], a similar song in major. Discords appear often in the Sacred Harp.One thing Sacred Harp composers have done is to give honor to other singers by attributing a composition to them. For example, [354t] by J. Monroe Denton was written in 1980, a year after the singer had died! It was written by Raymond C. Hamrick. Denton was a prominent South Georgia singer and singing master. Hugh McGraw wrote tribute songs for singers, dedicating the song through its title (e.g. [548] and [516]). Hugh McGraw assisted J. A. Ayers with writing [506]. Another gift song ([461]) written by Raymond Hamrick is attributed to Terry Wootten. Tribute songs discussed with titles indicating they were attributed to other singers were [503] (for Lloyd Redding and Loyd Landrum), [288], [313b], [464]. The practice of gift songs is not unique to Sacred Harp, and is a common practice to denominational hymnals as well. Another innovative sound since 1960 is ultra-dispersed harmony or sinewy sound. As an example, Robert led [485]. These ultra-dispersed songs often have very low basses and very high trebles. They often feature many discords or whole strings of discords. The class sang [504], [505], and [372]. Robert introduced another characteristic of new songs in the book called distinctive chords. The class sang [506], and Robert noted the unusual voicing of the 5-1-2 chord midway through the bottom brace. In [572], there is discordance at second-to-the-last chord and the alto preceding, written with Charlene Wallace in mind. Robert closed the session with [573].==Lesson: The Memorial Lesson==1:00 p.m. Jeanette DePoy began with the lyrics of the song that says “I belong to this band”. It is great to be part of a group like Sacred Harp singers. She said when she started singing she thought the Memorial Lesson was sad, but now it is her favorite part of the singing. Each of us can reach out to someone who is sick or shut-in by calling, sending an email, or mailing a card. People are asked, at a singing, to put those on the list that are sick, shut-in, or deceased. Most times there is a card for the sick that everyone at the singing can sign. It is nice for those who cannot attend a singing to know that friends signed a card for them. The following names of the sick and shut-ins were read: Violet Thomason, Cathy White, Bud Oliver, Sammie Oliver, Olga Haas, Daphene Causey, S.T. Reed, Lessie Reed, Josie Hyde, and Eugene Forbes. Cassie Allen led [172].Nathan Rees said the thing he most loved about Sacred Harp is the family and community. Nathan talked about one of the wisest men he had ever met through Sacred Harp singing. His community respected him so much that it named a highway after him. Through Sacred Harp, we meet a lot of older people we wish could be with us longer and we miss them when they are gone. The following names of the deceased were read: Lonnie Rogers-Georgia; Harrison Creel and Marie Ivey-Alabama; Diane Nelson and Robert Wert-Indiana; John Merritt-Mississippi; Alice Fahrbach-Michigan; Frank Evans-Virginia; Joan Fritz-Minnesota; Jeanne Schaffer-Colorado; James Wyllie-Pennsylvania; Ita Ryder and Mark Ferguson-Ireland; Phillip Higgins- United Kingdom. Nathan led [499] in memory of the deceased. The memorial service was closed with prayer offered by Jesse Roberts.Karen Rollins thanked Jeannette, Cassie, Nathan, and Jesse. Karen said the Memorial Lesson is about mourning, friendship, and love. It is a quiet moment to think of those we love. It is not unusual to see tears and hear laughter during a Memorial Lesson. Leading a Memorial Lesson is something you are asked to do. People do not usually volunteer to do a Memorial Lesson. Karen states that some places are not having Memorial Lessons and believes it is a tragedy. The older one gets, the more Memorial Lessons mean. Having a Memorial is a way to honor those who taught us. We sing for those on the list. It is a time when we confront our own mortality. The lyrics have a lot to say about death, and as we think about death, we carry on the tradition of those before us. It is our family obligation. The Memorial Lesson is one of the oldest parts of a convention and no one knows when they began. Sometimes, when asked to do a Memorial Lesson, you may have only thirty minutes notice. The steps in doing a Memorial Lesson are to compile a list of the deceased and sick and shut-ins, ask someone to speak, and choose songs to sing to honor each list of people. A person may read from a book, the Bible, or simply talk. Karen thanked the class for attending, and said she hoped that Memorial Lessons continue at Sacred Harp singings.==Elective: Patriotic-Secular Songs==2:30 p.m. John Plunkett began the class by reading an excerpt about “Chester” being sung by soldiers in the Revolutionary War as they marched to battle.

Jesse Roberts led “My Country Tis’ of Thee” and the class dismissed.==Lesson: Leading Boot Camp / Adults==4:00 p.m. This class was a critique class to help leaders be more comfortable in the square. Cassie began by stating that leading is not a show. There should be no dancing, stomping, or throwing your book on the floor. The class should be paying attention enough to follow. Do not beat too low or too high or you lose time. Keep your leading within a frame of modesty, which is between your shoulder and hip. If you make a mistake, smile, and keep leading! Keep your movements fluid, not choppy. Be confident and do not let the class lead your song for you. Always start and end a song with your hand up. Never sing a song so fast that you cannot sing every note. The "
