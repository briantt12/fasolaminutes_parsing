The Midwest Convention might not have happened at all, or kept going for these twenty years, except for all the assistance we had from so many people. It could very easily have been an ethno-musicology statement, or maybe had a piano in the square. But that was changed because of some very patient people who were eager to teach the Chicagoans the traditional methods of singing Sacred Harp. Without them, we would not be here today. Part of that learning and sharing community has passed away in the last twelve months. They are from all over the country, but especially the South. He read the names from the deceased list: Ivalene Donaldson, Sherry Guthery, John Hocutt, and Morris Nelson - Alabama; Anne Friend - California; Ann Cullor - Colorado; Elvera Lee, Floyd Peters, and Nick Pender - Georgia; Nancy Granda, Francis John Hennigan (father), John Francis Hennigan (son), and Ruth White - Illinois; Lois DePoy and Tom DePoy - Indiana; Pat Mudd - Kansas; Ray Pfau and Cliffie Windom - Michigan; Dave Grundmeier, Darlene McDonaugh, and Eric Swenson - Minnesota; Phillip Alderman - Missouri; Tom Gibney -- New Jersey; Phyllis Flandreau -- New York; Kelly Beard - Texas; David van Allen Hotaling - Washington; Roberta Seaton -- United Kingdom; Austin Burchett.Linda Thomas spoke on the bonds of traveling to singings. Some of the people on the list were on the bus trips Ruth Brown organized to bring singers to Chicago. From them, those who participated were given perhaps the greatest gift of all, memories of conversations and learning the deeper levels of those who traveled in such close quarters for many miles. Although her parents and grandparents sang Sacred Harp, Linda had not been raised singing the music. She remembers her first encounter with a large group singing the music and heard what she had never heard before, notes she had never known were part of the music. It was the bus trips that brought her to that experience. They made possible bonds in Sacred Harp that could not have been forged so quickly and deeply in any other way. Linda read the names of those deceased who had participated in the Midwest Convention over the past twenty years: Marie Creel Aldridge, Gerry Armstrong, Harvey Austin, John Bailey, John Beabout, Kelly and Helene Beard, Joseph J. Beasley, Janet Borman, Ezra C. Bowen, Ruth Burnham Brown, Leman Brown, Hazel Morris Cagle, W. Kimzy Cagle, Lessie Albright Cates, Jimmy Causey, Elder H.K. Childers, Lewis Everette Denney, Evelyn Dillashaw, John Flandreau, Runie Glover, Willa Mae Lacy Haney, J.C. Harden, Ralph Heath, Karen House, Dr. James Levert Howell, Dovey Jackson, Don Johnson, Don and Marilou Jolly, Robert Mottingdorfer, Ted Pankey, Virgil and Ruby Phillips, Jerilyn Schumacher, Manuel Slaughter, Alvin Stanson, Anne Tarsa, Marilyn Trier, D.T. White, Alice Williams, Dewey President Williams, Revy Wallace Williamson, Carlton Wood, Freeman Wootten, and Delta Wootten. Linda Thomas led [499] in their memory.Richard DeLong asked, “Where have the years gone?” They seem to be just a moment, albeit a very good one. And in another year, we will again visit in this place and again remember those who have died. Richard asked the front benches, the entire alto section and the basses to stand. Those standing equal in number those who died in the past year. Of all those singers he has known who are now dead all of them loved Sacred Harp more than any other earthly part of their lives. The blessings are so rich there is no price to place on them. These deceased singers, like many of us, thought of songs throughout the day, thought of lessons and people upon waking, and just before sleep. If you did not know these people, you can know two things about them. That they loved this music and that they were as deeply affected by it as those who are in the square today. Our hope is that they watch over us, even though they are no longer physically visible. They are yet visible in our hearts. One of our great comforts in this fellowship is that when the night of death comes on for us, we hope these souls will greet us with a song. He then led {285} in their memory.Jerry Enright led a memorial lesson for Kelly Beard. Kelly was a link with an older school of Sacred Harp, although he was not quite of it. Born in 1918, Kelly went with Tom Denson to a singing school in 1931. There were many children there, all hosted by farm families, some of whom took care of nearly a dozen children for the 20-day-Iong singing school. Kelly had a great love of the music and could key nearly any song in the book without looking at it. He started coming to singings in Alabama in 1961 and loved them very much. Jerry met Kelly in 1990 and the two formed a close friendship, meeting at many singings over the past 15 years. Kelly showed Jerry what a great love the Sacred Harp family can share. He was always himself and never tried to be anything but a good, genuine individual. Jerry expressed a hope to be like Kelly when he grows up. He then led one of Kelly’s great favorites, [339].Marcia Johnson said the Co-Chairs of the convention wanted to share and demonstrate the love Sacred Harp singers have for each other. She wanted something that symbolized growth and renewal. To that end she suggested we provide money for a grove of trees in the Holy Land, close to Jerusalem. Then, as the trees grow, so may our fellowship and the spread of peace. This was roundly supported by those present. Wendy Popp then closed the memorial lesson with prayer for those deceased and sick, concluding with a blessing for lunch.LUNCHJim Helke brought the class back to order for the afternoon session leading [171].

The Resolutions Committee gave special recognition of the outgoing and incoming Co-Chairs, Ted Mercer, Lisa Grayson, Marcia Johnson, and Ted Johnson, who handled our location crisis so competently and proficiently, finding a new location for singing in less than {24} hours when we lost our reservation with the University of Chicago; the Southern singers who made special effort to attend our singings these many long years. But especially we give thanks to Ted Mercer who endlessly answers questions about nearly any crisis, and handles all with calmness and humor in an unobtrusive way, rarely getting the recognition he deserves.The Finance Committee reported expenses had been met.The Secretary reported that 102 leaders led [162] lessons with leaders from 17 states and Canada.Announcements were made. The officers led [62] as the closing song, and those who so desired took the parting hand. Wendy Popp offered the closing prayer, and the class was dismissed.Co-Chairs - Ted Johnson and Marcia Johnson; Vice Chairs - Randy Neufeld and Susan Geil; Secretary - Cathryn Baker, assisted by Debbie Barford and Laura Clawson.
