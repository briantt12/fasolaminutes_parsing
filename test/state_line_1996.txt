She gave us some thoughts to reflect on: At this time we pause to remember our friends and loved ones who have passed away in the last year. Thereâ€™s a statement that says....The more material things we have, the more we have to worry about. This building we are singing in today is going back to the basics of life, and those who we are singing for today did the basic things in their lives by visiting the sick, sending cards, bringing food to singings, and inviting people to singings. Let us remember not only the deceased, but all of the sick and shut-ins. As we sing the song on page [348b], we must remember that our days are fleeting, and make the most of each day that we are here. The memorial was closed with prayer by David Lee.
